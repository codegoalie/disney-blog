## How do you get points?

Points are "depsited" into your account annually. Every DVC contract has a
point amount. It's this amount that gets added to your account annually. The
size of your DVC contract determines how many points you'll get. _When_ you get
those points is determined by something called your __Use Year__. Every DVC
contract has a Use Year. A Use Year is actually a month. It's the month of the
year in which you'll get your new points. For example, if your Use Year is
"April," then each April 1st you'll get your annual point allotment. Points
always arrive on the first of your Use Year month.

## How do you use points?

You can use your points to book a stay at one of the 16 DVC properties in Walt
Disney World Orlando FL, Hilton Head North Carolina, Vero Beach Florida, and
Disneyland California.  Each night costs a certain number of points. The total
cost of your stay is the sum of all the nights of your reservation. The point
amount of each night fluctuates based on the resort, room size, room view, and
time of year. DVC releases [point charts][1] each year which show the points for
each night in each room in each resort.

In order to book a stay, the full cost of the room, in points, must be available
in your account at the time of check-in. However, you can book a stay _before_
the points are available in your account. For example, if your Use Year is April
and you want to use your new points, you can check-in anytime on or after April
1st. However, you can __book__ your reservation even before April 1st.

There are limitations on how far in advance you can book a stay though. This is
where your __Home Resort__ comes into play. Each DVC contract also has a Home
Resort. The only advantage a home resort provided is early booking to _that_
resort. DVC allows booking a reservation 7 months in advance. However, you can
book a reservation at your home resort 11 months in advance, called Home Resort
Priority. This allows you a better chance to secure popular room types, or
popular dates ahead of DVC members with other home resorts. A rule of thumb
with DVC is "buy where you want to stay" to ensure you can book the stays you
want.

## How do you lose points?

Unfortunately, points do not last forever. As a rule, points are only good for
one year. If your Use Year is April, then your new points will be available on
April 1st, but your previous year's points will expire on April 1st as well.
__Fear not!__ Read on to find out two techniques to combine points from multiple
years.

## How do I combine years of points?

DVC provides two methods for combining points from multiple years up to 3X your
annual allotment. The first method is _borrowing_. Borrowing allows you to pull
future points to be used now. If you want to take a longer trip, stay in a
larger room, or visit during a more popular time, it might be necessary to
borrow points from your next Use Year into the current Use Year. You can borrow
at the time of booking your stay. __NOTE:__ Borrowed points cannot be returned
to their original Use Year. If you cancel your trip using borrowed points, the
points will remain in their _borrowed into_ Use Year and expire if not used.

The second method is _banking_. Banking is the inverse of borrowing. Instead of
pulling points from the future into your current Use Year. You can push current
points into the next Use Year.  You do not need to bank all of your points
either. Let's say you have 100 points but only take a trip that uses 80 points.
You can bank the remaining 20 and have 120 points available for the following
year. Note that points must be banked 4 months before they expire. See [our
banking deadline chart][2] to see when you need to bank your points.

## How do you get MORE points?

If you are still short on points after borrowing and banking strategically, you
do have a few options. DVC offers one-time use points for purchase. As of this
writing, points are $19 each and you can purchase up to 24 points each Use Year.
You cannot refund or transfer one-time use ponts, so be sure you know what you
need before purchasing.

Another method for getting more points is to purchase an Add-On Contract. An
add-on contract is similar to your original contract, but the minimum points
required to purchase are lower (as low as 25). Unlike one-time use points,
add-on points will be allocated each year. It may be possible to get a different
Home Resort for add-on points, but note that in order to use Home Resort
Priority (11 month booking window) _all_ points used to book must have that
resort as a home resort.
