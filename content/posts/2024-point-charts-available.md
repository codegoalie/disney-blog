Somehow these getting posted totally flew by my radar. But, we've got them
loaded now. Let me know if you notice any discrepancies.

One notable thing that stuck out to me while reviewing these was that
Thanksgiving is now split out and costing more points. Seems like that's
becoming a more popular time -- just like Chritmas. 

It will be interesting to see how these holidays shake out in the next few
years. Disney was absolutely moving toward a "squeeze as many dollars from each
guest" business model under Chapek. As such, it would make sense to pack folks
in during busy periods and jack up the Genie+, etc. surcharges. Disney is
disincentivized from spreading folks out and easing capacity under that model.
We'll just have to wait and see if off-time promotions ramp up, annual pass
sales, etc. all shake out.

Anyway, this post is about more data available in LineLeader, not a comment on
Disney Parks business models.

Hope everyone is having a magical new year so far!
