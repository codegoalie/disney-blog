This is a black band and features the EPCOT logo on the face with 90s style
accents around the band. We can see the some of the EPCOT attraction logos in
yellow and Figment's head in the picture provided.

I'm a huge fan of EPCOT and Figment. This band looks pretty cool. It seems like
90s throwbacks are resurgnig and this band seems right in line with the trend.
