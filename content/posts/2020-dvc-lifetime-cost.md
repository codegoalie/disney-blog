Point purchase price is not the entire story of DVC ownership cost.

<!--more-->

First, a little background. We bought into DVC in November 2019. Like most
everyone who purchases DVC or is
thinking about it, we did A TON of research. I'm a numbers guy. So, I created
spreadsheets, compared point charts, looked at different financing options, and
we tried our best to buy with our brains and not _just_ our hearts. When it was all
said and done, it was just over 3 years from when we first spoke to a DVC rep
until we actually bought. Still, after all of that, I didn't come across or
think to create these calculations: the lifetime total cost of DVC ownership
based on historical trends.

That's a mouthful. In plain english, this is the total amount you'll spend from
when you sign your contract until it expires. How much is that? A big number.
But keep in mind a contract spans decades. Buying into Riveria today will let
you enjoy DVC membership for the next 50 years.

I think the main considration for pretty much everyone when considering DVC is:
__will it save me money?__

The short answer is probably yes. If you plan to go to Disney at least every
other year for the next 40+ years, you can essentially pre-pay with DVC and
more than likely save money.

How much you will save and is that worth ponying up a good portion of money
up-front? Well, now we're getting to the heart of the matter.

There's a really hard (because it's subjective) comparison problem when
shopping for DVC. There is no such thing as apples to apples. Everyone values
aspects of their vacation differently. If you don't have DVC, you (pretty much)
are staying in a standard hotel room. With DVC, you have you
selection of room types. Even a night's stay in a studio DVC room is not really
comparable to a hotel room. Additionally, you could compare DVC to a 2 bedroom
rental off property. But then you'd have to quantify off vs on property. Then
there are the "cash rates" for DVC. But c'mon, are we really going to pay over
$400 a night for a studio at Old Key West?

So, if the question to answer is how much money will you save by getting DVC,
well... that depends. Personally, even if we didn't buy DVC, we'd stay on
property at a resort. Most likely a deluxe resort until our kids are old enough
to go open-to-close and then maybe we'd just use the room to sleep and would
go cheaper..., etc.

I did [those calculations too][1].

The point is: everyone is different.

For the sake of this post, I'm going to assume you're already on board with
purchasing DVC. The next question is where should you buy and how many points?

First rule of thumb, buy where you want to stay. Ok, so everyone buys at the
Poly and we're all in the bungalows every year. Right? Not quite. Turns out
each resort has very different costs associated with buying there. But we all
get essentially the same benefits. 

Case in point: my neighbor brought into Hilton Head some years ago. She did it
for her own birthday present. Total purchase price was around $8,000. Their
last trip was a Grand Villa at Old Key West. She says she never has issues
booking Walt Disney World at 7 months. $8k.

So, again, how to decide where and how many points?

Deciding the number of points is pretty straightforward. Think of the times
you have gone (or will go) to Disney. Look up [the points charts][2] for the
resorts you'd like to stay at. Add up the points you'll need for the length
and time of year. Viola! That's how many points you'll need. If you only
want to go every other year, cut that number in half.

So, where to buy?

All things being equal (which they aren't), you could buy into the cheapest
resort and still stay at any resort. Many people look at the cost per point
to purchase, assume that's the majority of their cost, and decide accordingly.
In reality, that's ___at best___ only half of the cost. Where you will probably
spend most of your money toward DVC is on annual dues.

> Initial purchase price is less than half of the total cost

This is where _the lifetime total cost of DVC ownership based on historical
trends_ comes into play. Since dues are over half of the cost of DVC, you
should definitely be paying attention to what those are now and __will be__
going forward. 

Luckily, [I've already figured this out][3].

The spreadsheet linked above factors in the initial purchase price, the current
annual dues, and the historical trend of annual dues for each resort and
forecasts a total lifetime cost per point per year.

Here's the numbers-only comparison of each DVC resort. Look at column L. Red is bad.
Green is good.

A couple of caveats here:

1. We don't know what Disney will do each year with dues. They are backed by
  the actual budgets for each resort. This assumes what's happened in the past
  will continue to happen.
1. Riveria is less than a year old. The dues actually when down $0.0018 from
  2019 to 2020. We know that's not an actual trend. Dues don't get cheaper. So,
  I've used the average of all the other resorts as its average dues annual
  increase.
1. The same goes for Copper Creek Canyon.
1. This assumes linear, constant increases in dues. I.e. the current average
  amount of increase will persist throughout the rest of the contract. More
  study will need to be done to determine if this is actually true.

Had you considered lifetime dues during your purchase decision making process?
Do you agree with my assessment? Let me know in the comments.

Thanks for reading and happy home shopping!
