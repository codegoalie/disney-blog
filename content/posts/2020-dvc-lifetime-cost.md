First, a little background. We bought into DVC in November 2019. Like most
everyone who purchases DVC or is
thinking about it, we did A TON of research. I'm a numbers guy. So, I created
spreadsheets, compared point charts, looked at different financing options, and
we tried our best to buy with our brains and not _just_ our hearts. When it was all
said and done, it was just over 3 years from when we first spoke to a DVC rep
until we actually bought. Still, after all of that, I didn't come across or
think to create these calculations: the lifetime total cost of DVC ownership
based on historical trends.

That's a mouthful. In plain english, this is the total amount you'll spend from
when you sign your contract until it expires. How much is that? A big number.
But keep in mind a contract spans across decades. Buying into Riveria
today will let you enjoy DVC membership for the next 50 years.

I think the main considration for pretty much everyone when considering DVC is:
__will it save me money?__ 

The short answer is yes. If you plan to go to Disney at least every other year
for the next 40+ years, you can essentially pre-pay with DVC and save money.

How much you will save and is that worth pony-ing up a good portion of money
up-front? Well, now we're getting to the heart of the matter.

There's a really hard (because it's subjective) comparison problem when
shopping for DVC. There is no such thing as an apples to apples. Everyone values
aspects of their vacation differently. If you don't have DVC, you (pretty much)
are staying in a standard hotel room. With DVC, you have you
selection of room types. Even a night's stay in a studio DVC room is not really
comparable to the hotel rooms. Additionally, you could, for instance, compare
DVC to a 2 bedroom rental off property. But then you'd have to quantify off vs on
property. Then there are the "cash rates" for DVC. But c'mon, are we really going
to pay over $400 a night for a studio at Old Key West?

So, if the question to answer is how much money will you save by getting DVC,
well... that depends. Personally, even if we didn't buy DVC, we'd stay on
property at a resort. Most likely a deluxe resort until our kids are old enough
to go open-to-close and then maybe we'd just use the room to sleep and would
go cheaper..., etc. 

I did (those calculations too)[1].

For the sake of this post, I'm going to assume you're already on board with
purchasing DVC. Where should you buy and how many points?

First rule of thumb, buy where you want to stay? Ok, so everyone buys at the
Poly so they can get the bungalows every year. Right? Not quite. Turns out
each resort has very different costs associated with buying there. But we all
get essentially the same benefits. 

Case in point: my neighbor brought into Hilton Head some years ago. She did it
for her own birthday present. Total purchase price was around $8,000. Their
last trip was a Grand Villa at Old Key West. She says she never has issues
booking Walt Disney World at 7 months. $8k.

So, again, how to decide where and how much?
