We bought into DVC in November 2019. Like most everyone who purchases DVC or is
thinking about it, we did A TON of research. I'm a numbers guy. So, I created
spreadsheets, compared point charts, looked at different financing options, and
tried out best to buy with our brains and not just our hearts. When it was all
said and done, it was just over 3 years from when we first spoke to a DVC rep
until we actually bought. Still after all of that, I didn't come across or think
to create these calculations: the lifetime total cost of DVC ownership based on
historical trends.

That's a mouthful. In plain english, this is the total amount you'll spend from when
you sign your contract until it expires. What you'll find are some large numbers, but
I was also surprised at the impact dues have.
