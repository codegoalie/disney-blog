We bought into DVC in November 2019. Like most everyone who purchases DVC or is
thinking about it, we did A TON of research. I'm a numbers guy. So, I created
spreadsheets, compared point charts, looked at different financing options, and
tried out best to buy with our brains and not just our hearts. When it was all
said and done, it was just over 3 years from when we first spoke to a DVC rep
until we actually bought. Still after all of that, I didn't come across or think
to create these calculations: the lifetime total cost of DVC ownership based on
historical trends.

That's a mouthful. In plain english, this is the total amount you'll spend from
when you sign your contract until it expires. What you'll find are some large
numbers. But keep in mind a contract spans across decades. Buying into Riveria
today will let you enjoy DVC membership for the next 50 years.

There's a really hard comparison problem when shopping for DVC. There is no
such thing as an apples to apples. If you don't have DVC, you (pretty much)
are staying in a hotel room. With DVC, you have you selection of room types.
Even a night's stay in a studio DVC room is not _really_ comparable to the
hotel rooms. You could get a, for instance, compare DVC to a 2 bedrrom rental
off property. But then you'd have to quantify off vs on property. Oh then
there's "cash rates" for DVC. But c'mon, are we really going to pay over $400
a night for a studio at Olk Key West?

So, if the question to answer is how much money will be save by getting DVC,
well... that depends. Personally, if we didn't buy DVC, we'd stay on property
at a resort. Most likely a deluxe resort until our kids are old enough to go
open to close and then we'd just use the room to sleep, etc.

I did (those calculations too)[1].

The answer is yes, for pretty much everyone, you will save money with DVC. But
that's not really a surprise now is it?
