Planning your DVC getaway can be almost as much fun as taking the vacation. The
anticipation, choosing your adventures and attractions, imagining yourself
enjoying a delicious Dolewhip all help to create that pre-trip buzz. However,
for many of us, there are stressful moments too. Is this the best plan? Could we
do more? Am I getting the best deal? For Disney Vacation Club members, there can
be additional, treacherous waters to navigate by choosing how best to spend your
already purchased points. In this post, I'll show you how I go from idea to
booked when planning my DVC vacations.

# Step 1: Choose your dates

Often our dates are chosen for us, for better or worse. With school, work,
other family/friends, etc., many times dates are chosen for us. So, step 1 done,
right? Not so fast.

With DVC, not all times of the year are created equal. The cost of a room per
night can vary as much as 3X* just depending on when you want to book. If you
do have flexibility in your dates, take a few minutes to browse the [DVC points
charts][3]. The lower priced stays are listed at the top. Check if any resorts
are cheapest when you are already planning to go, or if you could go during
those times.

For Walt Disney World resorts, these are typically: 

- September
- January
- Beginning of December

Another consideration for picking dates are special events at Walt Disney World,
these often appear during relatively slow times to try and drive guest
attendance. Check out for [RunDisney races][4], [Epcot festivals][5], and
[holiday parties][6] to name a few.

If you are still struggling to find a good time to go to Disney World, dates
that have a personal significance can make great holidays. Celebrating your
special day with a Disney vacation is something truly special some personal
celebrations might include: a birthday, honeymooon, anniversary, first job,
retirement, birth of a child. That last one might actually be kinda hard to
pull off. ;) Maybe celebrating the last child out of diapers would be more
feasible. Personal celebrations are great not only because of they often don't
coincide with already busy times, but Disney cast members are always bringing a
little extra magic for celebrations.

Once you have some dates in mind, it't time to decide _where_ to stay.

# Step 2: Find the best stay possible

So, you've got some dates in mind and you are ready to decide on your home for
your trip. You might think the hard part is over, but this step is actually
where most of the actual work takes place.

 
  
   
    
      and some of the real differences
between DVC and regual resort booking show up. With a typical Walt Disney World
Resort hotel (or any hotel, really) booking, you go to the site, enter your dates, see how much it
will set you back, and book. Whenever you feel like traveling, there's a reservation for you. It's a bit different with DVC.

First, you can only book at most 11 months in the future for your home resort and 7 months for all other resorts. 

DVC themselves do not provide a global search of all reservations. You can only
search to check-in 11 months from 

DVC has (for whatever
reason) decided that planning a trip should b

Actually booking your stay is a little different than booking a normal hotel reservation. For starters, you can only book at most 11 months I'm advance for your home earlier (and only 7 months for all other resorts). We usually plan our visits years in advance, but with DVC, you can't lock that resort reservation in until your booking window opens.That's ok though! DVC releases point charts 2 years in advance, so you can be prepared when you're booking window opens.

On top of booking windows, how you post for your stay is different too.

\* The largest points per night variance of a single room type at any Walt
    Disney World Resort is a Tower Studio Standard View at the Riviera Resort
    which can be as cheap as 9 points per night or as many as 27 in 2021, or
    3X. Across all DVC properties, a Deluxe Studio Standard View at Hilton
    Head which varies from 6 to 27 points per night (4.5X).
