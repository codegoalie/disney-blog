Called "Disney Parks 2023 MagicBand+", this new band features an minimalist
illustrated castle in the center with Mickey on one side and starbursts or
fireworks on the other. It's hard to see much else from the one image available.

This style matches the rest of [the Disney Parks 2023 collection][1].
