We've just seen a price increase in the [online add-on tool][1] for Copper
Creek, Hilton Head, and Vero Beach.

<!--more-->

Copper Creek Villas and Cabins at Disney's Wilderness Lodge has just had an
__increase in price by $5__ up to __$225 per point__. It's been about a year
since a price increase here.

Addtionally, Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort has just had their pricing __increase by
$5__ as well up to __$140 per point__. It's been at least a year since Disney
increased the direct purchase price too.

Similarly, Disney's Vero Beach Resort had it's price __increased by $5__ up to
__$125 per point__.

This only increases lifetime cost by that $5 per point, or $500 for a 100 point
contract. This is still relatively small compared to the [estimated][2] $34,456
for Hilton Head and $39,297 for Vero Beach that you'll spend on dues for the
same 100 point contract.

The community often make a lot of initial price increases, but the annual dues
increases [more greatly][3] affect the total amount of money you'll pay over the
lifetime of your contract.

Finally, we haven't seen price increases at Animal Kingdom, Boulder Ridge, Old
Key West, Saratoga Springs, and Grand Floridian in about the same time frame as
the above resorts. Perhaps they are next for price increases?
