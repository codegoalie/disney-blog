We've just seen a price increase in the [online add-on tool][1] for Hilton Head
and Vero Beach.

Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort has just had their pricing __increase by
$5__ up to __$140 per point__. It's been at least a year since Disney
increased the direct purchase price which was at $135 per point.

Similarly, Disney's Vero Beach Resort had it's price __increased by $5__ up to
__$125 per point__.

This only increases lifetime cost by that $5 per point, or $500 for a 100 point
contract. This is still relatively small compared to the [estimated][2] $34,456
for Hilton Head and $39,297 for Vero Beach that you'll spend on dues for the
same 100 point contract.

The community often make a lot of initial price increases, but the annual dues
increases [more greatly][3] affect the total amount of money you'll pay over the
lifetime of your contract.
