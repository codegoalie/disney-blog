With the new 2020 pricing charts out, here's a look at how each resort's annual
dues increased. Was Disney able to stay within their 4-6% increase average? Did
some resorts beat the average? We'll also take a look at any purchase price
increases.

# Highest Annual Dues Increases

First up are the annual dues. Here are the 5 resorts with the highest annual
dues increases:

## 1. Disney's Vero Beach Resort

Disney's Vero Beach Resort comes in at #1 overall with the highest amount
raised with $0.65 per point. 2020 dues for Vero Beach are now at $10.13 up from
$9.48 in 2019. This is a 6.86% increase. It is interesting that the highest
increase comes to a resort that's not on Disney theme park property. This
illustrates why looking at annual dues in important before, during and after
making your Disney Vacation Club purchase. In fact, over the life of your
contract, you end up spending more money on dues than the in the initial
purchase price.

## 2. Disney's Old Key West Resort

Sliding into the second spot is Disney's Old Key West Resort with a $0.61 hike
in annual dues per point from a year ago. In 2019, dues were $7.23 and they sit
at $7.84 in 2020; a whopping 8.44% increase. Old Key West has the highest
percentage increase this year out of all the resorts. This is interesting since
Old Key West is the original DVC resort and is on the lower end of purchase price
per point.

## 3. Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort

The bronze place is occupied by Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort. Owners here
were handed an additional $0.54 per point for their annual dues. This brings
the total due to $9.10 per point up from $8.56 last year; a 6.31% change. It's
again worth pointing out that two of the top three raises are on properties not
at a Disney theme park. 

## 4. Aulani, Disney Vacation Club Villas, Ko Olina, Hawai'i

Heading way out west for number 4, Aulani, Disney Vacation Club Villas, Ko
Olina, Hawai'i is the first resort on our list to stay in the "average range"
of annual dues increases although just barely with a 5.98% increase. This brings
dues from $7.86 in 2019 to $8.33 in 2020, a $0.47 difference.

## 5. Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge

Disney Vacation Club is asking owners at Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's
Wilderness Lodge to pay 6.28% more (again above the stated average of 4-6%)
on annual dues this year. Last year dues per point were $7.32 and in 2020
they are $7.78.

# Lowest Annual Dues Increases

## 0. Disney's Riviera Resort

Disney's Riviera Resort had no increase in dues from 2019 to 2020. They remain
at $8.31. However, I've placed them at #0 since they only opened up on December
16th, 2019 and it would seem
